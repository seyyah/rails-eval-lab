  # Pure calculation object. No database writes, no side effects.
  # Takes raw metrics + baseline, returns all score components.
  #
  # Scoring formula (0–100 scale):
  #   Query Reduction  × 0.60  (max 60 pts)
  #   Time Reduction   × 0.30  (max 30 pts)
  #   Stability Bonus  × 10    (max 10 pts)
  #
  # Reductions can be negative (student made it worse).
  # total_score is floored at 0.0 — no negative totals.
  #
  # Stability measures reproducibility: how close are this run's
  # metrics to the previous run? First attempt always gets 0.
